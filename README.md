#HealthTrack-Pro

Implemented a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to capture and store patient information, health issues, and prescribed medications in a SQL database. This stored data can be accessed later for printing prescriptions and searching patients' medical histories.

The project utilizes `Python tkinter` for **frontend GUI design**, `Python MySQL.connector` for **integrating Python with the MySQL server**, and `MySQL server` for **backend data storage**.
