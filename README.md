#HealthTrack-Pro

Developed a comprehensive Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed to efficiently capture and store a variety of patient information, including personal details, health issues, and prescribed medications, within a SQL database. This stored data is structured to facilitate easy retrieval, enabling functionalities such as printing prescriptions and searching patients' past medical histories.

This project employs Python tkinter for frontend GUI design, ensuring a user-friendly and interactive interface. For database connectivity, Python MySQL.connector is used to integrate Python with the MySQL server, providing seamless communication between the application and the database. The MySQL server is utilized for backend data storage, ensuring that all patient information is securely and systematically stored for future reference.
